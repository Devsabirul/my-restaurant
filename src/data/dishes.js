Also brushed it with a low sodium teriyaki sauce & added a grilled pineapple along with it for more pizazz.  My guest loved the changes. Slow is wonderful but added toasted almond slices.",

Our recipe uses tangy gouda, creamy mozzarella, and a hefty dose of red onions and cilantro for freshness. We happen to think it gives good ol' CPK a run for their money.",
